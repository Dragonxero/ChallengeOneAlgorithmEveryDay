# Java Algorithms
A list of little algorithms.

## Attention!!
I decide to start a challenge and write one algorithm a day!
All days a new algorithm!!! :muscle: :smile:

### ChunkeyMonkey :monkey_face:
> Chunkey Monkey makes an array to a multidimensional one.

### Mutations :ghost:
> Returns true if the string in the first element of the array contains all the letters of the second
> element of the array.

### SeekAndDestroy :mag:
> It will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or
> more arguments. This removes all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

### Where Do I Belong :question:
> Returns the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument).
> The returned value should be a number.
> For example,
> ```java
> WhereDoIBelong wdib = new WhereDoIBelong ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1.8);
> System.out.println(wdib.getIndexToIns());
> ```
> should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).

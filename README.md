# Challenge!! One Algorithm Every Day!!!

I decided to start this challenge to improve as a programmer and to enter to the laboral market with experience :smile:

## Attention :exclamation: :exclamation:
> I decide to start a challenge and write one algorithm a day!
> All days a new algorithm!!! :muscle: :smile:

**Completed algorithms: 7**

---------------------------------------

### ChunkeyMonkey :monkey_face:
> Chunkey Monkey makes an array to a multidimensional one.

### Mutations :ghost:
> Returns true if the string in the first element of the array contains all the letters of the second
> element of the array.

### SeekAndDestroy :mag:
> It will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or
> more arguments. This removes all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

### Where Do I Belong :question:
> Returns the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument).
> The returned value should be a number.
> For example,
> ```java
> WhereDoIBelong wdib = new WhereDoIBelong ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1.8);
> System.out.println(wdib.getIndexToIns());
> ```
> should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).

### Diff Two Arrays :dolls:
> It compares two lists and returns a new list with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both.
> In other words, returns the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

### Search And Replace :memo:
> Performs a search and replaces on the sentence using the arguments provided and returns the new sentence.
> First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.
> Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).
> Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).
> Preserves the case of the original word when it is replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it will be replaced as "Dog".

### Pig Latin :pig:
> Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".
> If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.

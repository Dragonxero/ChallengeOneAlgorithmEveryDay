/**
 * A couple of numbers m and n are called friendly (or known as a friendly couple), if the sum of all divisors of m (excluding m) is equal to the
 * number n, and the sum of all divisors of the number n (excluding n) is equal to m (with m â‰  n).
 *
 * For example, the numbers 220 and 284 are a friendly couple because the unique numbers
 * that divide accurately 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, and:
 *  1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284
 *
 * Therefore, 220 is a friendly number. The only numbers that divide exactly 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142 and:
 *  1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220
 *
 *  Therefore, 284 is a friendly number.
